# Movie Recommender System
A Jupyter Notebook project that demonstrates the creation of a Movie Recommender System. This project utilizes Python libraries for data analysis, preprocessing, and building recommendation algorithms to suggest movies based on user preferences.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles raw data and prepares it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes and explores trends in the dataset.
- **Recommendation Algorithms**: Implements content-based and collaborative filtering methods.
- **Evaluation**: Measures the performance of the recommendation models.

## Project Structure
```

├── movie recommender system.ipynb  # Main Jupyter Notebook
└── data/                          # Folder containing datasets (not included in repo)
```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher.
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
## Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository or download the files:
   ```
    git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```
  cd movie-recommender-system
  ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
## Usage Instructions

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
     ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open movie recommender system.ipynb.
3. Run each cell sequentially to preprocess data, build the recommender system, and view the results.
4. Follow the notebook instructions for modifying parameters or using different datasets.

## Datasets

Place your dataset(s) in the ```data/``` directory. Ensure the dataset format aligns with the preprocessing steps in the notebook.

## Future Enhancements

- Add hybrid recommendation systems.
- Integrate a user interface for real-time recommendations.
- Use larger, real-world datasets to improve recommendations.
